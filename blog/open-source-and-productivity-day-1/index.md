Open Source and Productivity - Day 1 (Fitness Tracking)

Mostly Everyone invests in Fitness/sports Watches when started the Workout as a regular routine

Most of our Fitness Activity Data's Stored in the Vendor server

if you want Privacy Sports Tracking then Just try Open Source Eco-system

For sport, tracking try this App - <https://github.com/OpenTracksApp/OpenTracks>

- No Internet access: Internet is not used
- No advertising
- No in-app analytics
- No use of Google Play Services

## Strava Sync

You can Just import the GPX File and export it to Strava

Check out My Strava CLI for GPX file Upload - <https://github.com/mskian/strava-bash-cli>

if you Have Amazfit & MI band use it as a Heart rate sensor for OpenTracksApp to get the Heart Rate Activity - <https://github.com/OpenTracksApp/OpenTracks/blob/main/README_TESTED_SENSORS.md>

it also has Gadgetbridge integration recently I started using it for My MI band 5 - My Favourite open-source App - No account is required - none of our Data are Stored in the vendor's server

For More Check - <https://gadgetbridge.org/>
Connect our Band/watch little tricky but very easy to integrate

## Final Notes

Finally, we never use official tracking apps for fitness activities
all our data are private and easy to delete while removing an app from the device
above app, codes are available on GitHub and Codeberg

Don't put MI Fitness or Amazfit watches into sleeping Mode after upgrading your Fitness/smartwatches ðŸ˜… Normally we just upgrade our Gear for advanced usage and Trackings
anyways Just play with your old Bands/watches and have fun âœŒ

## Bonus
